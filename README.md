#Diabetes Prediction using Elastic Net Logistic Regression

Introduction
This Python code predicts the presence of diabetes using the Elastic Net Logistic Regression model, a supervised machine learning algorithm that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. Elastic Net Logistic Regression is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that have correlated features or when you want to balance between L1 and L2 regularization.

Prerequisites
To use this code, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:

Python 3.7
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
Matplotlib (optional, for data visualization)

Datasets
diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv
From Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset
253,680 survey responses from cleaned BRFSS 2015 + balanced dataset
